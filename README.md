## Project Overview

Our goal is to **provide a convenient and user-friendly IDE** for **students learning computer organization**. Our target users are those who are studying this subject, and we have developed a range of features to enhance their coding experience.

To achieve our goal of providing a convenient and user-friendly IDE for students learning computer organization, our IDE incorporates various functionalities. We **leverage AI's API** to enhance the capabilities of our system, offering advanced features and intelligent assistance. Additionally, our IDE supports **multi-user simultaneous editing**, encouraging collaboration and teamwork among students. It also provides **code completion, highlighting, and error tips** to assist students in writing code efficiently and accurately. For debugging purposes, **robust debug support** is available, enabling students to analyze variables and resolve issues or bugs. The **"dump" functionality** allows students to inspect memory and register values, enhancing their understanding of program execution. **Built-in documentation** offers quick access to relevant information and resources, while the **"replace same name label"** feature helps students manage and organize their code effectively. Overall, our IDE aims to create a comfortable and enriching coding experience for students studying computer organization.

Overall, our overall goal is to **create an IDE that simplifies the learning process for students studying computer organization**. By providing a user-friendly interface and a range of powerful features, we strive to offer students a comfortable and enriching coding experience.

## Preliminary Requirement Analysis

### Functional Requirements

#### Using AI's API

As a assembly language programmer, I want to be able to directly ask questions about code to AI, so that I can complete programming tasks more quickly and accurately.

#### Multi-user Simultaneous Editing

As students for Computer Organziation cource, they need to write assembly code for their self-design cpu. So that to improve the efficent of debug and coding, multiple user simultaneous editing.

#### Code Completion, Highlighting, Error Tips

As a developer, I want code completion, highlighting, and error tips so that I can write code more efficiently and identify and correct errors quickly during development.

#### Debug Support

As a MIPS programmer, I want to step through my code line by line, so that I can understand the flow of execution and identify where errors occur.

#### Dump

As a embedded developer, I want to be able to dump my code into the real microcomputer so that I can simply run it in the actual situation.

#### Built-in Documentation

As a beginner in assembly language, I want to be able to view documentation directly within the editor, so that I can access the necessary knowledge without having to open a browser and disrupt my workflow.

#### Replace Same Name Label

As a picky coder, I want to do lable rename like IDE's symbol rename. So that I can reduce errors caused by misstake and improve my coding experience.

### Non-functional Requirements

#### Usability

The usability of our IDE is a key consideration. We have designed it to be accessible and compatible with multiple platforms, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. This allows students to use our IDE on their preferred operating system, providing flexibility and convenience.

#### Safety

Ensuring the safety of user code is of utmost importance to us. Our IDE has implemented strict security measures to prevent any leakage of user code to unauthorized individuals or external sources. We prioritize the privacy and confidentiality of our users' work, creating a secure environment for their coding projects.

#### Security

In addition to safeguarding user code, our IDE focuses on maintaining overall security. We have implemented measures to prevent memory leaks, ensuring that system resources are properly managed and utilized. By addressing potential security vulnerabilities, we strive to provide a secure coding environment for our users.

#### Performance

To enhance the performance of our IDE, we have optimized the execution of assembly code. Our IDE is designed to run assembly code quickly and efficiently, minimizing any delays or slowdowns during the execution process. By prioritizing performance, we aim to provide a smooth and seamless coding experience for our users.

#### Data Requirements

We need **assembly language documents** and **AI API keys** in this project. To get assembly language documents, we may use web pages from official assembly language documents. And we may apply for AI API keys directly on their official websites.

#### Technical Requirements

We will use **Tauri** to develop our application. The operating environment is desktop OS such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Tauri is a **multi-platform** desktop application framework with **Rust** as backend and **Javascript** as frontend.

## 开发规范

- 在各个分支开发，完成后在 github 提交 pull request，审核后合并到 main 分支
- 分支命名规则:
  - feat-xxx（新功能）
  - fix-xxx（修复 bug）
  - refactor-xxx（重构）
  - doc-xxx（文档）
- commit message 规范：使用[约定式提交](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/zh-hans/v1.0.0/)
- rust 代码提交时需要进行格式化，否则无法通过 CI，可以使用 "cargo fmt" 一键格式化

## 开启多个实例

注意！因为distDir不能重复，之前多开会有NextJS加载不上的问题，现在每次开启Moras都会在src-ui下生成一个数字的文件夹作为distDir，记得及时清理。
